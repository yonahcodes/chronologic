# chronologic

Research and implementation project focused on developing calendrical calculation algorithms in Python based on principles from Reingold & Dershowitz's "Calendrical Calculations". This project documents my journey studying Reingold & Dershowitz's 'Calendrical Calculations', testing various implementation approaches, and building a Python library for calendar computations. Includes exploration of datetime handling, astronomical calculations, and mathematical algorithms, with comprehensive testing and documentation of learnings throughout the process.
